    "# Writing Functions in Python\n",
    "### Course Description\n",
    "You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!"

    "Python's flexibility around data types is usually cited as one of the benefits of the language. It can occasionally cause problems though if incorrect data types go unnoticed. You've decided that in order to make sure your code is doing exactly what you want it to do, you will explicitly check the return types of all of your functions and make sure they are what you expect them to be. To do that, you are going to create a decorator that checks that the return type of the decorated function is correct.\n",
